    A rose is either a woody perennial <br />flowering plant of the genus Rosa (/ˈroʊzə/),[1] in the family Rosaceae
    (/roʊˈzeɪsiːˌiː/),[1] or the flower it bears. There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of
    cultivars.[citation needed] They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems
    that are often armed with sharp prickles.[2] Their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy,
    in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds
